		"Several years passed since the Last War. In fact, it would be more like several centuries. The nuclear winter covered the earth with ashes, turned the water brown and made the air so toxic than few of us barely survived.",
		"Nobody remembers exactly what launched the Last War. Nobody remembers who won it, because in the end, it doesn't matter. There is few records of this period, or the one before : the computers crashed and the various recordings were erased by the nuclear blast.",
		"The fallouts took centuries to decrease, and the society had to reinvent itself. We wanted to survive.",
		"On the 15th March 2931, we saw the first mammals outside the troglodyte bunkers that sheltered us. It took some decades before we decided to go outside too. We created some explorer groups, in order to reconquer our world.",
		"I'm one of these explorers, and even if I lost my group in a sandstorm, I decided to continue. The radio signal I received may come from other survivors..."

		"If you can hear this record, it means you have received the signal of my ship. I need you help.",
		"I don't know what happened, I've been in artificial sleep with my brothers and sisters, but they left without me. The ship must have had a problem : when I woke up, I was alone, and there were damages onboard.",
		"I'm not sure how to fix the ship, I didn't found its manual, and the food was missing. So, I put myself back in artificial sleep, hopping my people will help me...",
		"If you accept to help me, I would need you to find various items in order to repair my ship and to extract me from my artificial sleep : when I woke up, the timer was broken, I could only pray for somebody to come and save me...",
		"So, find your way in the ship, and gather the pieces of it. You're my only hope !" 
	],

	"lvl_4_intro": [
		"We had to protect our ships from intruders. There is two main mecanisms : warps and doors.",
		"Warps are linked two by two, you can go both way with them. Some of them can be used as entrance or exit of a room.",
		"The doors often react with switches. The red switch acts differently than others.",
		"Sometime, you can use items on devices. Just press \"space\", whatever it means, to do so."

	"lvl_0_intro": [
		"In the beginning they praised us like gods and goddesses, for long centuries. They couldn't understand our technology, it was miracles for them, and they burried their kings and queens in shrines shapes like our ships.",
		"Time passed. I don't know what changed, but the began to fear us. Then, they try to fight us, and we had to run away.",
		"I've already explained the next events... Please, don't abandon me !"
