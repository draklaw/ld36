		"Nobody remembers exactly what launched the Last War. Nobody remembers who won it, because in the end, it doesn't matter. There is few records of this period, or the one before : the computers crashed and the various recordings were erased by the nuclear blast.",

		"I'm one of these explorers, and even if I lost my group in a sandstorm, I decided to continue. The radio signal I received may come from other survivors..."
